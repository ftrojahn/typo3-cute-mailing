Cute Mailing is a **multilanguage** newsletter tool that spools and sends TYPO3 pages as emails to
many recipients. Cute Mailing can handle different types of recipient lists.
That is possible with so called "Connector Extensions". There are
two extension that introduce different recipient list for
`tt_address <https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/tt_address>`__ or
`registeraddress <https://github.com/lsascha/registeraddress>`__ :

* `undkonsorten/typo3-cute-mailing-ttaddress <https://github.com/undkonsorten/typo3-cute-mailing-ttaddress>`__ (if you just using tt_address data for recipients)
* `undkonsorten/typo3-cute-mailing-registeraddress <https://github.com/undkonsorten/typo3-cute-mailing-registeraddress>`__ (if you use tt_adress data and register recipients with the ext: registeraddress)

Cute Mailing is heavily inspired by luxletter but omits the rendering part to
focus on itâ€˜s main purpose:

Cute Mailing only does one thing: **Sending mails!**

We say thank you to the developers at In2Code for their good work.

.. important::

   CuteMailing does not provide HTML templates or plugins for newsletter
   subscription! There are ready-made solutions or tools that can be used.
