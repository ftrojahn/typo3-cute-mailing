What does it do?
================

We had been looking for a tool to send newsletters in TYPO3 for a long time.
Nothing that existed or exists met our requirements. We would have to make
compromises everywhere.

Therefore we decided to develop our own extension. Basically, it is only about
sending a TYPO3 page as an e-mail. For everything else in a newsletter
(subscribe/unsubscribe, html templates) there are ready-made solutions or tools
that can be used.
So CuteMailing only does one thing: **Sending mails!**

.. important::

   CuteMailing does not provide HTML templates or plugins for subscribing or
   unsubscribing to a newsletter!
