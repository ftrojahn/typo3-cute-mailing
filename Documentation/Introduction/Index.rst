What does it do?
================

We had been looking for a tool to send newsletters in TYPO3 for a long time.
Nothing that existed or exists met our requirements. We would have to make
compromises everywhere.

Therefore we decided to develop our own extension.

We used the TYPO3 extension "Luxletter" as the basis for our Cute Mailing.
There were already many ready-made functions concerning the dispatch. At this
point, we would like to say thank you to the developers at In2Code for their
good work.

Luxletter is a good newsletter tool but we want a tool only for sending a TYPO3
page as an e-mail.
And we wanted to be free in the choice of address types and not limited to
fe_users.

So now CuteMailing only does one thing: **Sending mails!**

.. important::

   CuteMailing does not provide HTML templates or plugins for subscribing or
   unsubscribing to a newsletter! There are ready-made solutions or tools
   that can be used.
