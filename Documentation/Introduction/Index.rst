Cute Mailing is a newsletter tool that spools and sends TYPO3 pages as emails to
many recipients. Cute Mailing can handle different types of recipient lists.
For the time being this is restricted to recipients in `tt_address` table but can
be extended to use e.g. `fe_user` data.

Cute Mailing is heavily inspired by luxletter but omits the rendering part to
focus on itâ€˜s main purpose:

Cute Mailing only does one thing: **Sending mails!**

We say thank you to the developers at In2Code for their good work.

.. important::

   CuteMailing does not provide HTML templates or plugins for newsletter
   subscription! There are ready-made solutions or tools that can be used.
