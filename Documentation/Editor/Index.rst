Editors can manage recipients and newsletters via a backend module.
Select the newsletter module in the module column on the left and then select
the newsletter area in the page tree.
First, 2 lists of recipients should be created.

.. tip::

   One list for the normal recipients and one list with a few addresses for
   a test mailing.

Now you can start the wizard by clicking on the button "Create new newsletter".

   Add new newsletter in backend

The fields have a description and are actually self-explanatory.

Once you have filled in all the necessary information, you can save the
newsletter. It will not yet be released for dispatch.
